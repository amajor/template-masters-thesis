\chapter{Background and Literature Review} \label{chapterBackground}

The background and literature review section needs to provide sufficient fundamental background information about the subject to support your objectives, hypothesis (or research questions) and methods, and review the pertinent literature related to the specific problem / hypothesis you are addressing. In Johnson (1991), some of the questions that he listed that the literature review should be to answer include: 

\begin{itemize}  
	\item what are the fundamental science, math, engineering concepts related to your research (scope),
	\item what part of your research work has ever been investigated before and what has not, (some of this may have been included in the introduction)
	\item how does your research work relate to that done by others, 
	\item how have others defined/measured/identified the key concepts of your research, 
	\item what data sources have you used or have other researchers used in developing general explanations for observed variations in a behavior or phenomenon in a concept in your thesis etc.  
\end{itemize}

The lit review (~20 pages or more) should not be limited to the above questions only. Ingeniousness and creativity is expected of a grad student.
Bullets can be single spaced.  The above bullets are in the style “thesis-bullets.”  When you type bulleted text, highlight the bulleted text and then select “thesis-bullets” from under the format, style menu to automatically change their formatting as above.

Sub heading (heading 3)
The subheadings here have a different format (“heading 3”) than the section headers.

Sub-sub heading (heading 4)
You can even get to another level of headers, defined here as “heading 4.”  The table of contents, however, is currently set up to just include three levels of headers.

Equations
Equations can be created in MS WORD equation editor or they can be created with other software.  Equations should be numbered.  They can be numbered within each chapter (e.g., 2.1, 2.2) or they can be numbered sequentially throughout the entire thesis.  Equations should be indented or centered with the equation number to the right.  The example below and associated “thesis-eqn” style can be used for all your equations.

This equation was written with the equation editor. Found through “insert, object, equation editor 3.0. The equation editor can also be found through “tools, customize, commands”, and in categories, look for insert and in the commands section, look for equation editor, drag and drop the icon onto the toolbar. This editor is fine for relatively simple equations, other options are available for more complex equations.

Tables
Tables should have meaningful information with descriptive headers.  You can use the “thesis-table caption” style to define your captions and refer to the table in the text with a “cross reference” (Table 1).  MS Word re-numbers table captions automatically when new tables inserted.  But you need to right click on any cross references and “update field” if there are changes.

Figures
Figures and illustrations are a necessary means of communicating technical information.  Often times, figures included in the background/lit review section are copied from existing copyrighted information.  In all cases, this is technically inappropriate without also receiving permission from the copyright owner.  Citing the source of the figure is not sufficient. This rule is enforced for PhD dissertations because they are submitted to ProQuest for electronic access by others.  The enforcement of this rule for MS theses is dependent on the specific committee members.
Resolution of figures is often a problem in theses.  Resolution should be >300 dpi, preferably 600dpi (Figure 1).  You should note that saving images as jpeg files is a sure way to lower the resolution to an unacceptable extent.  From experience, a good way is to copy your graphic (for example from PowerPoint or excel) and when pasting it into word, use the “paste special” “as an “enhanced metafile” (Figure 2).  This also substantially reduces the resulting file size in comparison with pasting graphs in as excel graphics.
