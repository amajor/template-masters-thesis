\chapter{Methodology} \label{chapterMethodology}

In addition to the detailed methods you need to describe in this section, you need to provide specific objectives and an overview of your approach if they have not already been presented in the introductory chapters.  The best place to put those items can vary among theses.  Sometimes the background and lit review is really necessary to justify and substantiate the specific objectives and approach and, therefore, it is best to save those details for the beginning of this chapter.

These paragraphs are in “thesis-body text.”  Other styles including captions, headers etc. can be used as presented in the previous chapter.  Table 2 summarizes all of the styles that can be used with this template.
