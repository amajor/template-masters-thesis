Gratitude is a great virtue, though revenge is profitable

It's customary and good manners to say thank you however, where do you draw the line? In some of the theses that I've read, and I write this after having read thousands, literally, the following and more have been acknowledged: God, one's advisor, one's better half, parents, children, friends, classmates, lab-mates, lab technicians, lab assistants, pets, fav. Prof, neighbors, physicians, exercise trainer(s), wiki, the maintenance guy, landlord, the school hockey team, secretary, department head, driver, dentist, chauffer, the police, fav. presidential candidate, one's chef, Led Zeppelin, the pastor, one's biggest crush, the cable man, the mani/pedi girl, hair stylist, the best/worst/fav bar tender(s), the janitor, one's obs/gyn, one's mentor, and in a more recent thesis, Michael Phelps (8 gold medals at the 2008 Olympic games in Beijing, China, way to go...)

Keep in mind that one has to use one's own words when writing an acknowledgement. Plagiarism is unauthorized.
