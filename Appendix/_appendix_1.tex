\section*{Appendix A} \label{sectionAppendixA}

Type or paste your appendices here. Appendices are a place to organize and include all of the “extra” material that is important to your research work but that is too detailed for the main text.  Examples can include: specific analytical methods, computer code, spreadsheets of data, details of statistical analyses, etc.  But, these materials do not speak for themselves.  There should be a reference to these materials from the main chapters (complete details included in Appendix A) and there should be some text at the beginning of each appendix to briefly explain what the information is and means that is included in that appendix.
