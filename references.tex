\section*{References} \label{sectionReferences}

Includes all references: articles, media facts, books, reports, regulations, internet articles, papers that you referenced from the text.  In the text, citations can be (Smith and Jones, 2007) or Smith et al., 2007) (if more than two authors) if you wish to present your references alphabetically.  Alternatively, you can include the citations in the text as a number [1] or 1 if you wish to present your references numerically.  The MS WORD tools – “insert, reference, footnote, endnote” (or “cross reference” if you refer to the same reference more than once) should be used to help you organize and manage your references.

References can be written in single space with extra space between references as in the format below.  There are many different ways to arrange the information and punctuation in a reference listing.  The most important thing is to make sure all references are complete and that the format of your references is consistent throughout. 

Example, S.Z. (2008). How to cite a complete journal reference. J. Complete Thesis. 1(2): 47-52.

Example, S.Z., Second, W.S. (2007). How to cite a complete conference proceedings paper. In: Proceedings, 2nd International meeting of Masters Students, Paper \# XW15 (Potsdam NY, November, 2007).

If you use the “thesis” reference” style you will get the proper line spacing and indent style without further changes. Above are examples to show complete citation, other formats also acceptable.

\subsection*{Alternative format:}
An alternative format for references is to use IEEE format. You can find a reference on IEEE format here:  http://www.ijssst.info/info/IEEE-Citation-StyleGuide.pdf

You can use either the option provided above in the template or use the IEE format. 

We should cite something \cite{sample:docs}.
