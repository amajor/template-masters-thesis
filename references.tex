% Includes all references: articles, media facts, books, reports, regulations, internet articles, papers that you referenced from the text.  In the text, citations can be (Smith and Jones, 2007) or Smith et al., 2007) (if more than two authors) if you wish to present your references alphabetically.  Alternatively, you can include the citations in the text as a number [1] or 1 if you wish to present your references numerically.  The MS WORD tools – “insert, reference, footnote, endnote” (or “cross reference” if you refer to the same reference more than once) should be used to help you organize and manage your references.

We should cite something \cite{sample:docs} so that it appears in the bibliography. We are using the IEEEtran format in this template.
